# The QDPI-61,440 Matrix: The Living Glyph Table

*Every move is a possible AI or narrative act in the Gibsey system.*

Below is the *generative matrix* for QDPI‑61,440—**every “cell” is a unique glyph/move/event**.

> **What's New in this Version:**
> Expanded to 10 actions and 6 modalities for maximum expressiveness, resulting in 61,440 unique glyphs. This version aims to provide a comprehensive framework for a wide range of interactions.

### 2. Visual Encoding: Glyph Structure

* **Left gates (4):** *Who acts*—open/closed bits, which roles are “speaking”
* **Right gates (4):** *Who receives*—open/closed bits, who is “addressed”
* **Internal/External (“n”/“u”):** Symbol shape—Princhetta for internal, Cop-E-Right for external
* **Rotation:** N/E/S/W, sets role/perspective
* **Context/State:** Encoded as overlay or flag in UI/logic
* **Relation:** Direction of action (subject/object); each glyph is always a move in a sentence

### 3. Example Row ("Sentence")

| Action | Context    | State     | Role     | Relation | Polarity | Rotation | Modality | Glyph Meaning                                                                                             |

| Write  | Reaction   | Private   | Human    | O→S      | External | E        | Audio    | "Human writes a private audio reaction, receiving input, via Cop-E-Right, rotated East"                   |
| Forget | Generation | Public    | Part/Sys | S→O      | Internal | W        | VR       | "A subsystem initiates forgetting, as a public VR event, internal state, rotated West"                    |
| Dream  | Prompt     | Sacrifice | WholeSys | O→S      | External | S        | Video    | "The whole system dreams in response to a prompt, sacrificing, producing a video externally, rotated S" |

### 4. Glyph Matrix Cell: How to Read

* **Action:** React
* **Context:** Reaction/Draft
* **State:** Public
* **Role:** Human
* **Relation:** Subject→Object
* **Polarity:** External ("u"/Cop-E-Right)
* **Rotation:** 90° (East)
* **Modality:** Audio

> **Meaning:** "A human, acting as subject, externally reacts (as Cop-E-Right), drafting a public audio reply, facing East in the grammar."

---

### 5. Visualization

* Imagine as an **8D hypercube**—each axis a “slider” or “gate.”
* In a UI, “slide” axes or rotate glyph to select action/context/role.
* Each glyph is **addressable**, **renderable**, and **stateful**.

---

## Further Considerations & Technical Details

* **Minimal Encoding Size:** To uniquely address every one of the 61,440 glyphs, you will need 16 bits of information ($2^{15} = 32,768$; $2^{16} = 65,536$). This means each glyph can be represented by a 2-byte identifier.
* **Backwards Compatibility:** Any system or dataset previously designed for earlier iterations like QDPI-4096 or QDPI-24576 can be considered a subset of this expanded QDPI-61,440 space. Glyphs from those systems can be mapped directly, ensuring continuity.
* **Future Expansion:** The matrix is designed to be extensible. If/when you decide to add new options to existing axes (e.g., new modalities, actions, or roles), or even new axes entirely, the total number of glyphs can be recalculated by multiplying the new number of options. For example, adding a 7th modality would change the calculation to $10 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 2 \times 2 \times 4 \times 7 = 71,680$ glyphs.

**Every cell is a glyph. Every glyph is a move. Every move is a story, an action, a protocol event, a ritual, or a memory.**
