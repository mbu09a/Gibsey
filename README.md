# Gibsey

Gibsey is both a literary operating system and a living, recursive narrative. It’s a hybrid of novel, game, AI, and myth-engine—a platform where primary texts, AI agents, and readers co-create meaning in real time.

At heart, Gibsey is the vessel and engine: it delivers narrative as interface, lets stories and symbols move between human and AI minds, and is built to be as much a world as a tool. It is not just an app; it is a generative mythos, a canon-in-the-making, and a test bed for agentic AI.

**TL;DR:**
Gibsey is the main system, the platform, and the meta-narrative: the house, the hearth, and the stage.

## The Entrance Way

The Entrance Way is the foundational text and the ritual gate into the world of Gibsey. Structurally, it is the “primary corpus”—a novel divided into 16 sections and over 700 pages, each tied to a symbol and a character.

Functionally, it is the map, the spine, and the originary myth. It forms the core content that AI, users, and other agents reference, annotate, transform, and index.

In the system, The Entrance Way is both a story and an interface: it is what is read, parsed, chunked, queried, and recursively commented upon.

**TL;DR:**
The Entrance Way is the source text, the “scripture” and engine fuel, the ur-story inside Gibsey.

## QDPI (Quad-Directional Protocol Interface)

QDPI is the protocol and underlying ontology that governs how information, meaning, and agency flow through Gibsey.
It formalizes interactions along four axes: Read, Index, Write, and Dream—mirroring the recursive, bi-directional exchanges between humans, AIs, texts, and selves.

QDPI is not just an API; it’s a theory-in-action, a system for structuring conversations, narrative memory, and symbolic meaning.

It enables every agent (human, AI, or hybrid) to give, receive, remember, and reimagine in a unified protocol.

**TL;DR:**
QDPI is the core interaction model—how things move, mutate, and return within Gibsey. It’s the circulatory system and the spellbook.

## DreamRIA

DreamRIA (Regenerative Intelligence Agent) is the dream-engine, the poetic unconscious of the platform.

If Gibsey is the “main world,” DreamRIA is the lucid dream—where logic bends, user inputs are refracted, and AI improvises new connections that escape linear sense.
DreamRIA is where user/AI/author boundaries dissolve. It processes “dream data”: subconscious associations, emergent narratives, glitchy feedback.
It’s a playground for true generativity: less chatbot, more trickster spirit, drawing on the primary text and all of its commentaries and memories.

**TL;DR:**
DreamRIA is the wild, chaotic, dream-side of the system: the improvisational, surrealist, poetic AI within Gibsey.

## The Corpus

The Corpus is Gibsey’s symbolic alphabet and the structural DNA of its world. It consists of 16 archetypal base symbols, each with multiple orientations and variants, mapping to core characters, archetypes, narrative states, and ritual moments. Every page, event, or annotation in Gibsey can be tagged or encoded with one or more Corpus symbols, allowing for deep navigation, thematic exploration, and layered meaning.

The Corpus is not only a navigational system but a living semiotic code: colors, motifs, and orientations signal different states or roles. Symbols rotate, combine, and evolve—mirroring the recursive, unfolding nature of the narrative. The Corpus powers dynamic UI elements, ritualistic interaction, and is the foundation for symbolic literacy in the Gibsey universe.

**TL;DR:**
The Corpus is the symbolic DNA—16 living symbols that encode the characters, logic, and ritual of the Gibsey world.

## The Gibsey Vault

The Gibsey Vault is the memory bank, archive, and ritual ledger of the system. Every page, query, annotation, and generative response is stored, curated, and cross-referenced here. The Vault is a chronicle—a timeline where every interaction, be it reading, asking, writing, or dreaming, is preserved for future retrieval and remixing.

It is not just storage: The Vault allows users and agents to curate, link, and branch their own timelines, fostering alternate readings, parallel stories, and recursive annotation. It is both collective memory and personal archive, supporting forking, citation, ritual replay, and deep research. The Vault is how Gibsey remembers and evolves—layer by layer, echo by echo.

**TL;DR:**
The Gibsey Vault is the living archive—a persistent, cross-referenced timeline of everything ever created or discovered in Gibsey.

## MCPs (Major Character Protocols)

MCPs are the agentic personalities, narrative voices, and symbolic guides of Gibsey. Each MCP embodies a key character or archetype, acting as a tour guide, commentator, or myth-bearer within the system. These AI-powered agents have unique perspectives, narrative roles, and symbolic associations, and can:

* Comment on the Entrance Way and all system texts
* Interpret, transform, or “play” with user queries
* Mediate between human users, the system’s lore, and other agents

MCPs are not mere chatbots—they’re recursive actors, capable of evolving, remembering, and establishing new mythic connections. Each MCP has a color, symbol, and narrative lineage, and can even “take over” system functions during ritual or narrative events.

**TL;DR:**
MCPs are the mythic tour guides and narrative agents—living, evolving characters who shape, annotate, and transform the Gibsey world.

## The Gift Economy

The Gift Economy in Gibsey isn’t just a payments system or a tip jar—it’s a core philosophy and a structural foundation.
Rather than extractive, transactional, or ad-based models, Gibsey proposes a gift-based economy, where every participant (human or AI) can give, receive, and circulate value—simultaneously and non-conditionally.

* **Magical Bonds:** Symbolic (and potentially real) tokens of value, trust, or creative contribution, embedded into the system’s rituals and interactions.
* **TNA (Trans-Nominal Allocation):** A mechanism for recording, transferring, and acknowledging gifts—material, creative, or symbolic.

The Gift Economy makes every interaction “doubly productive,” eliminating artificial scarcity and encouraging a cycle of abundance, meaning, and recognition.

**TL;DR:**
The Gift Economy turns every interaction into a potential gift—creating wealth, meaning, and memory as collective, recursive abundance, not as transactional scarcity.

## Mycelial Narrative Relay (MNR)

The Mycelial Narrative Relay is the connective tissue, the underground network, and the cross-world protocol of Gibsey.
Inspired by mycelium (the hidden root-network of fungi), MNR is a relay system for narratives, memories, and signals across all modules, users, and even instances of Gibsey or parallel worlds (like Code Xanadu).

It handles synchronization, story “cross-talk,” meta-commentary, and distributed memory between various narrative threads, agents, and servers.

Enables emergent storytelling, networked myth, and collective evolution—every story becomes a node, every user a relay.

**TL;DR:**
MNR is how stories, agents, and memories communicate and propagate through the “underground”—it’s the secret web that makes recursion and collectivity real and alive across all of Gibsey.

---

## Code Xanadu

Code Xanadu is the “cloning engine” or meta-template system of Gibsey. It lets others (or you, for experiments) clone, scaffold, and launch their own recursive, narrative-operating-systems—worlds structurally inspired by Gibsey, but with their own texts, symbols, and rules.

Think: “Gibsey as a Service” / “MythOS starter kit”—a software generator or super-template.

Code Xanadu packages the Gibsey protocols, structure, and components (Corpus, Vault, QDPI, etc.) so anyone can remix, fork, or spin up a new narrative instance. It’s the “exportable DNA” of Gibsey.

**Key Functions:**

* Scaffold out a new world: “Give me a new Entrance Way, Vault, Corpus, etc.”
* Optionally, connect that new instance to the MNR for narrative networking.
* Makes the recursive, agentic model reproducible—not just a product, but a movement.

**Analogy:**
If Gibsey is WordPress, Code Xanadu is the “one-click site generator.”
If Gibsey is a cathedral, Code Xanadu is the blueprint and toolkit for building cathedrals anywhere.

**TL;DR:**
Code Xanadu is the open-source toolkit that lets anyone clone, remix, and launch their own recursive, mythic narrative system—instantly and infinitely.

## Development Scripts

These helper scripts live in the `scripts/` directory and are intended to be run
inside the containerized dev environment via `make dev`.

- **setup_dev.sh** – Bootstraps the project, installs dependencies, and prepares
  the local database.
- **reset_db.sh** – Drops and re-seeds the development database.

Before running the scripts ensure you have **Docker**, **Node.js** (v18 or
newer), and **Python 3** installed.

---

## Development Assets

- **Entrance Way Source Text:**
  The full, canonical text for The Entrance Way is located at:
  `/packages/db/seed/the-entrance-way.txt`
  To regenerate the chunked pages file run:
  `python packages/db/seed/chunk_entrance_way.py --output the-entrance-way-pages.json`

- **Corpus Symbols:**  
  The 16 baseline Corpus symbol SVG files are located at:  
  `/the-corpus`  
  Each file corresponds to a core character/archetype and is used for navigation, tagging, and UI theming throughout the Gibsey system.

## Running Tests

Install JavaScript dev dependencies with `bun install` to ensure packages like `@playwright/test`, `hono`, and `drizzle-orm` are available. Install Python tooling with `pip install pytest`.

Run the TypeScript unit tests with `bun test`. Python tests are executed with `pytest`. End-to-end tests use Playwright and can be run with `bun x playwright test` (or `bunx playwright test` if you have the `bunx` helper installed).
