## Test Agent

The `test_agent.py` script fetches a page from the local API and posts a fake comment. It can be used during development or automated tests to ensure the agent pipeline works.

Run it from this directory with:

```bash
python test_agent.py
```

Ensure the API server is running on `http://localhost:3000` before executing the script.
