# Example Event Payloads

This folder contains small sample payloads illustrating how events might be recorded in Gibsey.
Each event references an encoded glyph value (hexadecimal in these examples) that describes the
symbolic state associated with the action.

* **link-event.json** – shows a `Link` event connecting two pages.
* **merge-event.json** – demonstrates a `Merge` event combining multiple user contributions.

Glyph values are placeholders derived from the QDPI-4096 matrix.
