# Vault Example: Dream Move in Video Modality

This example shows how a single move might be recorded in the Gibsey Vault.
It uses the full QDPI axes including **Modality**.

```yaml
id: 42
timestamp: "2025-05-21T12:00:00Z"
action: Dream
context: Prompt
state: Gift
role: Whole System
relation: Objectâ†’Subject
polarity: External
rotation: S
modality: Video
content: |
  A shimmering montage appears, narrated by the system.
  Colors flicker across the screen as the dream answers the prompt.
```

### First AR Move (Narrative Log)

The first time an AR glyph fired, the user held their phone over the
page. Symbols rotated eastward, the room glowed, and the system
whispered a welcome. That moment was logged as the inaugural **AR move**
and marked a new chapter in the Vault.
