# Documentation Audit Report

Generated: 5/28/2025

## Executive Summary

This audit reviews all markdown documentation in the Gibsey repository for outdated information, missing content, inconsistencies, and other issues. The documentation is generally comprehensive but shows signs of being written at different stages of development, leading to some inconsistencies and gaps.

## Issues Found

### 1. Outdated Information

#### Root README.md
- **Development Scripts section (lines 141-152)**: References scripts in `scripts/` directory (`setup_dev.sh`, `reset_db.sh`) and containerized dev environment via `make dev`, but these files/commands don't exist in the current repository
- **Running Tests section (lines 168-173)**: Mix of package managers mentioned (bun, bunx, npm) without clear guidance on which to use
- **Development Assets section (lines 155-167)**: References Python script for chunking but doesn't match the actual location or current implementation

#### AGENTS.md
- **Entrance Way API section (lines 96-202)**: API examples show POST requests to `/trpc/{procedure}` but modern tRPC typically uses different request formats
- **Local Development section (lines 26-39)**: Lists requirements but doesn't mention actual setup steps or environment configuration

### 2. Missing Setup Instructions

#### Root README.md
- No instructions for:
  - Database setup and initialization
  - Environment variables configuration
  - First-time setup process
  - Development server startup sequence

#### apps/web/README.md
- Minimal content, missing:
  - Development setup
  - Build instructions
  - Environment configuration
  - Testing instructions

#### apps/api/README.md
- Only one line of description, missing all setup and usage information

### 3. Incomplete API Documentation

#### AGENTS.md
- **QDPI System API section (lines 214-314)**: 
  - Examples are commented out, making them less useful
  - Missing actual endpoint URLs
  - No authentication details for protected endpoints
  - Missing error response documentation

#### Missing API Documentation
- No documentation for:
  - Authentication endpoints
  - Role-based access control
  - Error handling patterns
  - Rate limiting
  - WebSocket/real-time features

### 4. Missing Architecture Diagrams

No visual diagrams found for:
- System architecture overview
- Data flow between components
- QDPI glyph encoding visualization (beyond the SVG reference)
- Database schema relationships
- Authentication flow
- Event/message flow through the system

### 5. Inconsistent Formatting

#### Multiple Files
- Inconsistent header levels (some use ##, others use ###)
- Mixed code block languages (```bash vs ```shell)
- Inconsistent list formatting (- vs * for bullets)
- Varying line lengths and spacing

#### docs/scratchpad.md
- Mix of date formats (2025-05-19 vs other formats)
- Inconsistent section separators (--- vs =======)

### 6. Dead Links

#### Root README.md
- Line 161: References `/packages/db/seed/chunk_entrance_way.py` but actual path needs verification
- Docker and Make commands referenced but no Dockerfile or Makefile found

#### the-QDPI-matrix.md
- Line 31: References `docs/qdpi-hypercube.svg` - file exists but link format may not render properly in all viewers

### 7. Missing Examples

#### QDPI-spec.md
- Complex specification but lacks concrete implementation examples
- No code samples showing how to encode/decode glyphs
- Missing examples of actual QDPI moves in practice

#### docs/timeline-linking-design.md
- Design document without mockups or concrete UI examples
- Missing API payload examples for linking/merging

## Discrepancies with Implementation

### 1. File Structure Mismatches
- Documentation references `scripts/` directory with shell scripts that don't exist
- References to Docker/Make commands without corresponding files
- Python scripts mentioned in different locations than documented

### 2. API Implementation Gaps
- AGENTS.md shows tRPC procedures that may not match current implementation
- Role permissions documented but implementation details unclear
- QDPI encoding described in detail but actual implementation not referenced

### 3. Missing Component Documentation
- Services documented in directory structure but lacking implementation details
- Test structure documented but actual test coverage unclear
- Database migrations mentioned but not documented

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Update README.md with accurate setup instructions
2. Remove references to non-existent files and scripts
3. Add proper environment setup documentation
4. Create consistent API documentation with working examples

### Short-term Improvements
1. Add architecture diagrams using Mermaid or similar tools
2. Create a proper getting-started guide
3. Document all environment variables
4. Add troubleshooting section

### Long-term Enhancements
1. Implement automated documentation generation from code
2. Add interactive API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI)
3. Create video tutorials for complex concepts
4. Establish documentation review process

## Positive Findings

1. **Comprehensive Vision**: The high-level documentation (README.md, QDPI-spec.md) provides excellent context
2. **Detailed Specifications**: QDPI specification is thorough and well-thought-out
3. **Good Organization**: Documentation is well-organized in logical directories
4. **Forward-thinking**: Documentation includes plans for future features

## Priority Issues to Address

1. **Critical**: Missing setup instructions preventing new developers from getting started
2. **High**: Outdated script references that will cause confusion
3. **High**: Incomplete API documentation blocking integration work
4. **Medium**: Missing architecture diagrams hindering understanding
5. **Low**: Formatting inconsistencies affecting readability

## Conclusion

The Gibsey documentation is ambitious and comprehensive in scope but needs updates to match the current implementation. The philosophical and design documentation is strong, but practical implementation details are lacking. Addressing the setup instructions and API documentation should be the highest priority to enable developer productivity.
