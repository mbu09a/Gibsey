# Ritual Metrics

Gibsey tracks key interactions to understand how readers and agents move through the narrative. These ritual metrics cover everything from page views to how often a symbol appears.

## Tracking Modality

Metrics now record the medium of each Dream or ritual. When an event is logged, its modality is storedâ€”text, audio, video, or interactive. For example, the system counts how many video Dreams occur during a session.

## Impact on Narrative Branching

Modality affects how branches unfold. A sequence with a high number of video Dreams might unlock multimedia paths, while text-only rituals keep the story in a prose-first mode. Agents use these counts to decide which narrative tools to employ and when to prompt the user for different types of engagement.

## Influence on Agent Actions

Agents reference these metrics to adjust their behavior. If a reader favors audio or video Dreams, agents prioritize those channels for hints or lore drops. The ledger of modalities helps maintain a balanced ritual experience and ensures new branches respect the preferred formats.
