# Implementation Plan Overview

This file summarizes the staged implementation plan for building Gibsey’s nine core systems. Each section defines the recommended sequence, dependencies, and task breakdowns to structure development for both human and agentic contributors. Use this overview as a roadmap; reference and extend with individual task files for feature-level detail.

---

## 1. The Entrance Way

**Purpose:** Foundation for content, navigation, and annotation.

**Tasks:**

* Import and structure all source text (16 sections, >700 pages) as chunked, queryable pages.
* Implement basic page/chapter navigation and querying API.
* Seed the database/storage layer with canonical content.
* Integrate with Corpus tagging.
* Make available for UI and agent testing.

---

## 2. The Corpus

**Purpose:** Symbolic DNA; enables navigation, ritual UI, and tagging.

**Tasks:**

* Implement all 16 symbols (orientations, colors, motifs).
* Expose API/routes for querying symbols and metadata.
* Connect symbols to Entrance Way pages and narrative states.
* Enable dynamic UI/UX for navigation, selection, and theming.

---

## 3. QDPI (Quad-Directional Protocol Interface)

**Purpose:** Protocol/ontology for all exchange (read, index, write, dream).

**Tasks:**

* Define QDPI schema/protocol (including user/agent roles).
* Introduce role tiers: **Mythic Guardians** to oversee merges and **Guests** for ephemeral interactions.
* Build initial API endpoints/message handlers for QDPI actions.
* Wire into Entrance Way, Corpus, and Vault for recursion test.
* Document for agents and plugins in AGENTS.md.

---

## 4. The Gibsey Vault

**Purpose:** Memory bank, archive, and ritual ledger for persistent history.

**Tasks:**

* Implement Vault storage: log all queries, responses, annotations with metadata.
* Create Vault API: fetch, save, branch, replay, and fork timeline entries.
* Build curation tools: tag, favorite, filter, export/import.
* Integrate with Corpus and QDPI for symbolic indexing and tracking.

---

## 5. MCPs (Major Character Protocols)

**Purpose:** Agentic personalities, narrative voices, symbolic guides.

**Tasks:**

* Design/implement core MCPs (unique persona, color, symbol, “voice”).
* Connect MCPs to annotate/comment on Entrance Way and user actions.
* Enable MCPs to respond, interpret, and shift persona by context.
* Log all MCP actions in the Vault for memory and feedback.

---

## 6. The Gift Economy

**Purpose:** Gift-based value system; tokens of trust, recognition, and contribution.

**Tasks:**

* Implement Magical Bonds/TNA primitives (token structure, issuance, transfer).
* Build Gift API for giving/receiving between users, agents, and Vault.
* Log all gifts and acknowledgments in the Vault.
* Display gifts, bonds, and status in frontend and profiles.

---

## 7. DreamRIA

**Purpose:** AI dream engine; improvisation and surreal generativity.

**Tasks:**

* Implement DreamRIA as an AI module for narrative remixing.
* Allow DreamRIA to answer “dream” queries, remix pages, generate content.
* Integrate DreamRIA responses into the Vault and interface.
* Toggle DreamRIA as a mode in UI.

---

## 8. Mycelial Narrative Relay (MNR)

**Purpose:** Distributed memory and network relay; sync across users and instances.

**Tasks:**

* Build MNR as distributed message/event bus.
* Sync Vault, gifts, MCP actions across instances.
* Enable story cross-pollination, meta-commentary, global events.
* Integrate MNR config in Code Xanadu.

---

## 9. Code Xanadu

**Purpose:** Cloneable toolkit/meta-template for launching new Gibsey worlds.

**Tasks:**

* Scaffold Code Xanadu as a forkable, meta-template.
* Automate setup of all core systems for new worlds.
* Document config, extension, and MNR registration.
* Provide starter docs and AGENTS.md for new deployments.

---

## Development Flow (Suggested Order)

1. **Entrance Way** → 2. **Corpus** → 3. **QDPI**
2. **Vault** (hooks into 1–3)
3. **MCPs** (depends on 1–4)
4. **Gift Economy** (uses 1–5)
5. **DreamRIA** (needs 1–6)
6. **MNR** (syncs 1–7)
7. **Code Xanadu** (wraps/exports all above)
